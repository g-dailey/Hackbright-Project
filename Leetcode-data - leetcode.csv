Number of Different Subsequences GCDs--https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-subsequences-gcds--3--You are given an array nums that consists of positive integers.The GCD of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides all the numbers in the sequence evenly.Return the number of different GCDs among all non-empty subsequences of nums.
Minimum Absolute Sum Difference--https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-sum-difference--2--You are given two positive integer arrays nums1 and nums2 both of length n. The absolute sum difference of arrays nums1 and nums2 is defined as the sum of |nums1[i] - nums2[i]| for each 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).You can replace at most one element of nums1 with any other element in nums1 to minimize the absolute sum difference.
Finding the Users Active Minutes--https://leetcode.com/problems/finding-the-users-active-minutes--2--You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode and an integer k. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [IDi timei] indicates that the user with IDi performed an action at the minute timei. Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute. The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once even if multiple actions occur during it.You are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that for each j (1 <= j <= k) answer[j] is the number of users whose UAM equals j.Return the array answer as described above.
String Matching in an Array--https://leetcode.com/problems/string-matching-in-an-array--1--Given an array of string words return all strings in words that is a substring of another word. You can return the answer in any order. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
Stone Game III--https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iii--3--Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue. Alice and Bob take turns with Alice starting first. On each player's turn that player can take 1. 2. or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row. The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially. The objective of the game is to end with the highest score and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken. Assume Alice and Bob play optimally. Return "Alice" if Alice will win "Bob" if Bob will win or "Tie" if they will end the game with the same score.
Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One--https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one--2--Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s. return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules: If the current number is even. you have to divide it by 2. If the current number is odd. you have to add 1 to it. It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.
Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order--https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-subsequence-in-non-increasing-order--1--Given the array nums obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is strictly greater than the sum of the non included elements in such subsequence. If there are multiple solutions return the subsequence with minimum size and if there still exist multiple solutions return the subsequence with the maximum total sum of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be unique. Also return the answer sorted in non-increasing order.
Restore The Array--https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-the-array--3--A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits s and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range [1. k] and there are no leading zeros in the array. Given the string s and the integer k return the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as s using the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large return it modulo 109 + 7.
The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n--https://leetcode.com/problems/the-k-th-lexicographical-string-of-all-happy-strings-of-length-n--2--A happy string is a string that:consists only of letters of the set ['a'. 'b'. 'c']. s[i] != s[i + 1] for all values of i from 1 to s.length - 1 (string is 1-indexed).For example. strings "abc". "ac". "b" and "abcbabcbcb" are all happy strings and strings "aa". "baa" and "ababbc" are not happy strings.Given two integers n and k. consider a list of all happy strings of length n sorted in lexicographical order.Return the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than k happy strings of length n.
Queries on a Permutation With Key--https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-on-a-permutation-with-key--2--Given the array queries of positive integers between 1 and m. you have to process all queries[i] (from i=0 to i=queries.length-1) according to the following rules: In the beginning you have the permutation P=[1. 2. 3.....m].For the current i. find the position of queries[i] in the permutation P (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation P. Notice that the position of queries[i] in P is the result for queries[i]. Return an array containing the result for the given queries.
